					<h3 class='align-center'>Professional Biography</h3>
					<p>I'm passionate in the development of software and web applications. I'm self-sufficient in overcoming difficulties and tackling new and existing technical challenges. I love learning new technologies that push my own boundaries and setting new challenges for me to overcome; Learning is fun and overcoming struggles are rewarding. </p>
					<p>I am not afraid to step outside of my technical comfort zone and explore other various aspects of software engineering <p>

					<h3 class='align-center'>Beliefs/Ideologies</h3>
					<p>It is my belief that problems should be approached first from a high-level perspective.</p>
					<p>Careful planning of architecture allows for better code quality and modularity, which in turn allows easier code maintenance and feature integration. Continous code improvements and iteratation are necessary.</p>
					

					<p>My beliefs are not necessarily rooted to development alone. Outside of work, I learning why things works and what's under the hood. I love DIY projects and working hands on.</p>

							<h2><a href="https://esto.rev.reisys.com/" target="_">ESTO Review Evaluation System</a></h2>
							<h3>AngularJs, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Hibernate, Websocket, HTML/CSS</h3>
							<p>The Review Evaluation System (Review) was a rewrite of an older web application (early 2000s) in response to the growing business and technological needs of our client. The purpose of the system is to assist and facilitate the proposal review evaluation process (in this case ESTO's), by providing a role-based content management system while also providing real-time panel scoring during panel conference.</p>
							<p>Review is a enterprise single-page application and relies on AngularJS as the front-end MVC while using Spring and Spring Security for server side processing and business logic. It also uses Spring's websocket functionality to provide real-time client-server communication.</p>
							<p>As the lead developer of a 5-6 person team, I was solely responsible for creating and establishing the foundation of the project, including setting up the architecture and developing business logic workflow for both backend (Spring) and frontend (AngularJS). I was also responsible for implementing the website design from mockups and also made improvements to the UI and design for a more user-friendly and professional look.</p>
							<p>I also implemented the most crucial/significant modules to the system, such as proposal review submissions, and also real-time panel role-based panel scoring. In addition, I provided guidance, suggestions, designs, and code-reviews to other members of the team.
							</p>
							<p>I enjoyed the challenges and responsibilities on this project and felt that this project was my greatest accomplishment to date.</p>

							<h2><a href="https://esto.reisys.com/" target="_">ERS - Electronic Reporting System</a></h2>
							<h3>jQuery, Struts2, JSP, Hibernate, KendoUI, HTML/CSS</h3>
							<p>The Electronic Reporting System (ERS) is a content management system that handled and managed post award deliverables for NASA ESTO. It was also highly customizable and easy to use for reporting purposes. The success of ERS has lead to other NASA agencies (Applied Science, HEC, Astrophysics) to also adopt this tool for their post award deliverable management as well.</p>
							<p>ERS is a enterprise single-page application. It's dashboard allowed users to personalize the widgets used to manage and submit award deliverables. The many widgets are used for deliverable submission, alert tracking, award analysis, scheduling, etc.</p>
							<p>I was designated as the lead front-end developer on a 10-15 man team, but took on responsibilites on the backend/database side as well. I was responsible for designing and implementing the front-end architecture, UI, design, and workflow and tying it to the server-side code. In addition, I implemented the most challenging modules from end to end (DB call to business logic to front end ui/display).
							<p>This was the first major project in which I had a major development role. I learned much about implementing and upholding scalability, modularity, response design, and code maintainability.</p>

							<h2><a href="https://sbir2.st.dhs.gov/portal/SBIR/" target="_">DHS SBIR/BAA</a></h2>
							<h3>Struts2, TopLink, HTML/CSS, jQuery</h3>
							<p>The DHS SBIR and BAA program helped small businesses apply and compete for federal grants/awards. The client wanted public facing website was due for a redesign. I was brought in under the DHS team to assist them with the implementation of their public websites from the initial mockups.</p>
							<p>My role on this project was developing all the webpages (static and dynamic) and designing the UI and workflow as the mockups only covered the main page. I also pushed for responsive design. In addition to the front-end work, I also contributed server-side by optimizing and cleaning up business logic.</p>

							<h2><a href="https://www.reisystems.com/" target="_">REI Systems Inc.</a></h2>
							<p>I started out as a java developer at REI Systems on the NASA eBooks project, which handles grant management systems. Being on a small team led me to learn and take on different skills, leading to me overtime becoming a full stack developer. The company provided the opportunity for me to go above and beyond my assigned responsibilities. I was able to build incredible projects with incredible teams at an incredible company.</p>
